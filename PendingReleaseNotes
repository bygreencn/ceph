v0.89
-----

* New ability to list all objects from all namespaces can fail or return
  incomplete results when not all OSDs have been upgraded.  Features
  rados --all ls, rados cppool, rados export, rados cache-flush-evict-all
  and rados cache-try-flush-evict-all can also fail or return incomplete
  results.


v0.90
-----

* The 'category' field for objects has been removed.  This was originally added
  to track PG stat summations over different categories of objects for use by
  radosgw.  It is no longer has any known users and is prone to abuse because it
  can lead to a pg_stat_t structure that is unbounded.  The librados API calls
  that accept this field now ignore it, and the OSD no longers tracks the
  per-category summations.

* The output for 'rados df' has changed.  The 'category' level has been
  eliminated, so there is now a single stat object per pool.  The structure of
  the JSON output is different, and the plaintext output has one less column.

* The 'rados create <objectname> [category]' optional category argument is no
  longer supported or recognized.
